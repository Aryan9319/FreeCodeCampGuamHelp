Level 15-19 and beyond!

From now on we'll probably go through some HTML/CSS stuff **AND** a lesson or two on Javascript.  
That way we get some exposure to logical coding also!  



Today we went over the following tasks:

### HTML and CSS  

  - [Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-css-selectors-to-style-elements#?solution=%3Cstyle%3E%0A%20%20h2%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20color%3A%20blue%3B%0A%20%20%7D%0A%3C%2Fstyle%3E%0A%0A%3Ch2%3ECatPhotoApp%3C%2Fh2%3E%0A%0A%3Cp%3EKitty%20ipsum%20dolor%20sit%20amet%2C%20shed%20everywhere%20shed%20everywhere%20stretching%20attack%20your%20ankles%20chase%20the%20red%20dot%2C%20hairball%20run%20catnip%20eat%20the%20grass%20sniff.%3C%2Fp%3E%0A)  
   The highlighted portions within the `<style>` tags are all CSS Selectors.

   in the above picture, all `h2` elements will be blue, as well as all `p` elements.    
   We use `<style>` tags and CSS Selectors so that we don't have to put all our css styles **inline** with the html like this:

  That would take way too long.. and programmers are lazy!

  - [Use a CSS Class to Style an Element](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-a-css-class-to-style-an-element#?solution=%0A%3Cstyle%3E%0A%20%20.red-text%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20color%3A%20red%3B%0A%20%20%7D%0A%3C%2Fstyle%3E%0A%0A%3Ch2%20class%3D%22red-text%22%3ECatPhotoApp%3C%2Fh2%3E%0A%0A%3Cp%3EKitty%20ipsum%20dolor%20sit%20amet%2C%20shed%20everywhere%20shed%20everywhere%20stretching%20attack%20your%20ankles%20chase%20the%20red%20dot%2C%20hairball%20run%20catnip%20eat%20the%20grass%20sniff.%3C%2Fp%3E%0A)  

  - [Style Multiple Elements with a CSS Class](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/style-multiple-elements-with-a-css-class#?solution=%0A%3Cstyle%3E%0A%20%20.red-text%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20color%3A%20red%3B%0A%20%20%7D%0A%3C%2Fstyle%3E%0A%0A%3Ch2%20class%3D%22red-text%22%3ECatPhotoApp%3C%2Fh2%3E%0A%0A%3Cp%20class%3D%22red-text%22%3EKitty%20ipsum%20dolor%20sit%20amet%2C%20shed%20everywhere%20shed%20everywhere%20stretching%20attack%20your%20ankles%20chase%20the%20red%20dot%2C%20hairball%20run%20catnip%20eat%20the%20grass%20sniff.%3C%2Fp%3E%0A)  
  You can assign classes to html elements. This is just a way to easily apply styles to multiple elements.  
  Notice, both the `h2` and `p` element on the phone are orange.

### Video Challenges:  

  - [Computer Basics: What Do Programmers Do?](https://www.freecodecamp.com/videos/what-do-programmers-do)

### Basic Javascript  

  - [Comment your JavaScript Code](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/comment-your-javascript-code#?solution=%2F*%20var%20i%20%3D%200%3B%20%2F%2Fthis%20is%20a%20comment%0Avar%20x%20%3D%200%3B%20*%2F%0A%2F%2Fthis%20is%20a%20comment)  
  ```javascript
  var a = "this is code" //this is a single line comment  
  var b = "this is also code" /* this is a   
  multi-line  
  comment */  
  //var c = "this is commented out code. it will not be evaluated"``` 

  - [Declare JavaScript Variables](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/declare-javascript-variables#?solution=%0A%2F%2F%20Example%0Avar%20myName%3B%0A%0A%2F%2F%20Define%20myName%20below%20this%20line%0A%0A)  
  This task is important so please read the description carefully.  
##### We talked about the differences between  

  * `undefined` - not defined yet  
  * `null` - defined as empty  
  * `number` - like `1` or `24.5`  
  * `booleans` - `True` or `False`  
  * `strings` - lists of characters like `"Hello world"`.  
  Note: this is an empty string `""` which is different than `null`. Just like 0 is an "empty" number, not `null` 


If you'd like more information about what we talked about or would like mroe explanation, please ask us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/Chovin/GuamFreeCodeCamp)!
