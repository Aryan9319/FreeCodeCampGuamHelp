# Project Team

    A list of the contributors to the project that is the Learning Trail of our 1st campsite.  
  We would like to have a more structured course for our weekly campsite meetings.  
  So far we've only decided that we'll be going through 4 lessons a week and that we'll be explaining them during the campsite meetings if anybody needs help. We'll be recording the discussions in order to help the people that join later.
