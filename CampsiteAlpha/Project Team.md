# Project Team

    A list of the contributors to the building and management of our 1st Campsite   
    and probably by extension our whole Guam FCC chapter.

If you would like to help out with this campsite, please make a comment or PR to this file adding your name and github username followed by any areas you'd be interested in helping with. 
You don't have to choose areas/titles if you don't want to.  
If the title/area isn't there, please add it along with a short description.

## Projects
#### Learning Trail
We would like to have a more structured course for our weekly campsite meetings.  
So far we've only decided that we'll be going through 4 lessons a week and that we'll be explaining them during the campsite meetings if anybody needs help. We'll be recording the discussions in order to help the people that join later.

#### Prepare for island-wide launch
Get everything ready for our island-wide launch. This includes Familiarizing ourselves with the materials and community of FCC so that we can be good hosts for our new members once we invite the general public.
