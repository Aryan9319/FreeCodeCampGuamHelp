### Campsite Alpha's Learning Trail..

Feel free to suggest different names :smile:

Our Friday 3/4pm campsite meetings will be going through challenges together from here on out.

If you're 'behind' us on the trail, we'll leave footprints for you to follow.  
Please ask us to help you also! We're all in this together.

This trail will help people that can't make the meetings also

TODO: continue this readme later..
