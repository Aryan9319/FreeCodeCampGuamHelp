A Programming/Coding course is not a Math course so it can’t (and won’t) teach math concepts the same way a Math course would. It can, however, improve students’ understanding of math concepts by training them to combine both logic and creativity in order to solve problems.

*	As an introduction to programming, students will be taught how to come up with pseudo codes and algorithms.  Breaking down a problem in plain English and giving structure to the steps needed to solve it will help them understand it in a more logical manner. 

*	There are several different programming languages out there and all of them have unique syntax. What is important in a programming class is to teach students the concepts that are common to all languages – correct sequence of commands, conditional statements (if – else) and iterations (loops). Think of them as transferable skills.

*	We reinforce high school/college-level mathematical thinking by integrating them into our programming exercises. Abstract concepts are made more tangible when visualized in real-world situations.

Can a Programming course replace a Math course? No and we do not seek to do so. What it can provide is perspective – a fresh new way of tackling challenges, a deeper appreciation of the technology that we use every day, a skill they never knew they had. Sometimes, one quick summer workshop is all it takes to interest someone into taking up a new hobby or possible career path.
