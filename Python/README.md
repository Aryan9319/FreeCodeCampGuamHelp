1st thing's first. You'll want a nice text editor to make life easier for you.
We can recommend [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/).

###Pick your poison

| [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) | [Atom](https://atom.io/) |
| --- | --- |
| Free (like Winrar) | **`Free`** |
| Closed Source | **`Open Source`** |
| Fully Customizable | Fully Customizable |
| **`More Packages`** | Less Packages |
| **`Fast`** | Slow (uses Electron) |

*I use sublime so this page will focus on that editor.
