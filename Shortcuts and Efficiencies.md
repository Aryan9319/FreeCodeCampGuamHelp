Good coders try to limit their use of the mouse.  
If you're doing a lot of coding, having to take your hands off the keyboard to use the mouse slows you down!  

Let's look at some of the shortcut keys we can use to help speed up our coding and to help us stop relying on the mouse so much.

1st off is the infamous <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> and <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> for **Copy** and **Paste**  

You probably know what these do. <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> will *copy* the text you've `highlighted` and <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> will *paste* that copied text where your cursor is.
